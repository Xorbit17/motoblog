# Come on girls! Just admit it already

We are so smokin hot whatever we do with our bikes. But the poor, misguided women of today are so manipulated by feminists they can no longer admit this without looking like the girl equivalent of a total dork.

This is why I propose we cure feminism by doing very long wheelies and burnouts whenever we see a female.
